milestones

PHASE 1: Framework
 - model (the architecture that supports the world)
   * enumerate all abstractions
     - currently:
       * state machine - can be parameterized, general purpose that can be applied to objects, actors, and locations and hook actions (should support naive cartesian product)
       * object - a thing that the player can interact with
       * actor - a thing that can interact with objects (can be player controlled)
       * location - a thing that contains objects and actors with optional connections to other locations (exits are just objects that can be interacted with)
       * action - created when an actor "verbs" (with a direct object where applicable)
         action knows:
	  - location
	  - who committed the action (actor)
	  - what the action was applied to (direct object)
	  - the actual action (verb)
 - game (the story-driven elements)

PHASE 2: UI
