"press button" -> press button action -> boom event -> kitchen window break event
                                            |                   |
                                        explosion sound         |
                                                        glass breaking sound

Both the explosion sound and glass breaking sound are "transitive conditions" which
are created by events and added to a condition queue. After all events transpire for
the current loop iteration they are in (in the main loop), the transitive condition
queue is emptied by a print function in the main loop. The function will assess
what needs to be printed given the conditions. For example, if the player is in the house
and the explosion was in the forest, then the player should hear the boom coming
from the forest. However, if the player is currently wearing ear plugs, then the
player should not hear the boom. These conditions only exist in the current
iteration of the loop and do not exist anymore after the current iteration.
However, the states that were affected by the events are still changed, as states
in this current design are permanent. These conditions provide a way for
temporary information.
