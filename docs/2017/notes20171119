model:
    list of objects -> map of objects
    list of events -> map of events
    
    keyword indicies are unique and used to refer to them universally

refactor everything based on that
    apply-events should consume event-ids and not event-objs
        it can look up the event-objs from the ids

also, inventory objects that are not in the top level of the model should be references
    ex: player has hotdog, hotdog should be an ID referring to the hotdog object that the model owns
