* Examples
  - Object with composite state machine
    - A chest that can be upside down or right-side up, and also open
      or closed.
    - An object in a room that can be moved to multiple locations
      within the room
  - Room with multiple views
    - Look behind the couch
    - Look under the bed
* Roadmap
** PHASE 1 :: State Machine
   - can be parameterized, attributes
   - supports naive cartesian product
** PHASE 2 :: Framework
   1. model, the architecture that supports the world
      - object :: a thing that the player can interact with
       	+ optional data
	  - state machine :: minimum required states for the given object 
	  - sites :: Different views of the same object ("underside of the urn")
	    - There is always a "main" site
	    - Analogous to (perhaps specified by) prepositions
      - actor :: a thing that can interact with objects
	- an actor is an object?
       	- can be player controlled
       	- optional data:
          - state machine :: minimum required states for the given actor
      - location :: a thing that contains objects and actors
	- a location is an object?
       	+ optional data
	  - objects :: the objects it contains (exits are objects)
	  - actors :: the actors it contains
          - state machine :: minimum required states for the given location
      - action :: a thing generated by an actor that affects state machines
       	+ generated when an actor tries to DO something (verb, with a direct object where applicable)
       	+ required data
	  - verb :: the actual action
	  - actor :: who committed the action
       	+ optional data:
          - direct object :: what the action was applied to
          - location :: where it happened
   2. game, the story
      - TBD
** PHASE 2 :: UI
   - TBD
