parsing and action queries
currently action queries do parsing and execution
eventually we will want a dedicated parsing function (parseymcparseface?)
what will an action query be in that world?

refactoring of items
item:
  properties:
    map {name: type}
  actions:
    map {name: (conditions, effects)} // effects are not limited to current transitions, 
                                      // can be updates to properties (money++)
