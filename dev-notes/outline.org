* PHASE 1 :: State Machine
  - can be parameterized, attributes
  - supports naive cartesian product
* PHASE 2 :: Framework
  1. model, the architecture that supports the world
     - object :: a thing that the player can interact with
       + optional data
	 - state machine :: minimum required states for the given object
     - actor :: a thing that can interact with objects
       - can be player controlled
       + optional data:
         - state machine :: minimum required states for the given actor
     - location :: a thing that contains objects and actors
       + optional data
	 - objects :: the objects it contains (exits are objects)
	 - actors :: the actors it contains
         - state machine :: minimum required states for the given location
     - action :: a thing generated by an actor that affects state machines
       + generated when an actor tries to DO something (verb, with a direct object where applicable)
       + required data
	 - verb :: the actual action
	 - actor :: who committed the action
       + optional data:
         - direct object :: what the action was applied to
         - location :: where it happened
  2. game, the story
     - TBD
* PHASE 2 :: UI
  - TBD
